						The Faculty of engineering and technology have the mandate to train engineers and Carmel in a variety of disciplines just like a Coppola technically only with Trent engineer in such disciplines as telecommunications, power systems engineering software engineering and there are many more disciplines like similar civil engineering that will be opened in the future employment particularly self-employment is involved in the validation of the faculty the oldest and general schooling come on Polytechnic had a two-tier system of training where for the first years students did mainly science objects mathematics physics to reinforce the level that they brought from GCA level and the Bakken area so engineering training was betrayus as in Polytechnic so this five year program you have two years of science basic science and three years of engineering on from there 23 years of my career I was the head of the public for electrical engineering in a co-op only technical mountain so that was the vision now here in conformity with the anglo-saxon model of engineering training we don't divide the training into super scientific training and engineering training from day one our students begin engineering training under spend a considerable amount of time available phase so by the time they do a four-year bachelor of engineering degree they are considerable after Katrina which makes them act for work in industry and so maybe already setting up their own companies the whole vision from the one is geared towards proficiency in engineering in engineering disciplines and the aptitude to be able to set up enterprises then we're now either a to am master of engineering program on top of the four-year bachelor's of those who go on to do them and master's program I tended Putin Cynthia they are really very competent in in what they do so we realized the time has passed when governor will give a job to everybody for allow our students to develop the capacity to set on their own and this equipment in entire the initiative of in search in search as you heard during the ceremony just a group of Cambodia Pacers Muslim who came together just so clear they have so much know-how in the Diaspora there are mainly days in Germany the nor exclusively in the you said they have acquired a lot of know-how in the era and second technology courtesy why don't they plow something back to come to help the students here so that is that is the basic concept and they came up with this project with an interactive with them because our times when the donors will be defaulting what is needed some input from us we interacted with them and brought it project to fruition we will never have this type of equipment even in five years we have some equipment in renewable energy for fundamental teaching of various aspects like hydroelectricity so that whenever had this modern case where whether there is wind blowing or not whether the sunshine or no you can go see in the lab and simulate everything that is happening to train your students the laboratory sessions that we organize a we need a sunshine but only of the night and during the day or when the wind strength was sufficient to drive the turbine but what they are brought to us is a set of very modern equipment you can even I'm not practical sessions at night when there is no solar energy we can simulate the sunlight right in the laboratory so there's it's not been compared to what we had before how do you think we can secure this material other win to defeat what are your plans what plans do you have in the future for all of these equipments to be protected the requirement for this funding being granted was security and people being sure that what we're providing us equipment was able available in a secure environment so we've been through that with interacted with our research partners for over a year you know they have visited the university several times their representative was here and we looked at an abortion they were satisfied with the security arrangements we have even our own equipment those arrangements were adequate the way are not relating we now know that we have additional equipment is going to be an attraction so we have our own measure of success that not been through divorce now where does the locket and official idea originated from them they saw the in potential of renewable energy in Cameroon the potential of having a pool of equipment welcome O'Neill's such as can come to this mean is not limited to the University of oil researchers from different universities can come and do the risk they saw that their potential and they went unsolicited funding to to have their equipment so our gratitude is total you heard the deputy vice-chancellor in charge of research was the necessary will be project from the very inception or confidence of the universe of voya up God is not just a donation for the Faculty of engineering and to end by saying Anila bamboo - oh I see videos to my lovely wife and to all well wishes of the faculty of engineering and technology.
